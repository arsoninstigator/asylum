# cardigan nfc keychain

hi, it's my first time working with cad & fusion 360 and i made a keychain inspired by taylor swift's song on her folklore album called "cardigan" and her merch consisting of various cardigans representing her albums. <br>

<br>
## concept
- almost the same dimensions as the example keychain <br>
- cavity to insert an nfc sticker starts at 0.8mm <br>
- this requires the use of only two colors (either white x black, white x dark red or beige x black) <br>


## models
- step/stl files attached in the folder
